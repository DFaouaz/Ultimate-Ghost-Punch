# Game Concept
**Ultimate Ghost Punch (UGP)** is a local multiplayer fighting game where **up to four knights** can compete in frantic all-out battles to regain their glory, and most importantly, their right to live. Fighters can **swing their swords** quickly from the side, or with strength from overhead. They can also **grab** their oponents to throw them out of the arena, **jump and dash** to avoid dangers, or **block** any attack and grab with a well timed shield.

But beware, **the arenas** are full of dangers, and whenever a fighter dies in battle, he returns temporarily as **a ghost with the ability to steal other player's lives**, as a last-minute chance to avoid losing for good. With their lives in danger, players have fight while avoiding the ghosts in a frantic and hilarious experience **ideal for playing with friends**. So get your sword ready, and prepare for the fight that awaits you in Ultimate Ghost Punch.

# Lore

The entire kingdom gathers to watch the Ghost Games!

Years ago, **a curse** was casted upon the kingdom and condemned the dead **to return as ghosts**. The King ordered to lock all those affected **in the castle dungeons** and gradually the curse dissapeared from the kingdom.

Despite knowing the cure, the King has taken this opportunity to create **a show that attracts tourists, money and fame** from the other kingdoms.

The king created a tournament where the soldiers who were **affected by the curse**, and were not treated yet, have to face each other in **a battle of eternal death**. The victor gains his freedom and the cure to the curse.

You are one of those soldiers and you must **show your skill and cunning in combat** against the rest.
