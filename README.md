# Lore

The entire kingdom gathers to watch the Ghost Games!

Years ago, a curse was casted upon the kingdom and condemned the dead to return as ghosts. The King ordered to lock all those affected in the castle dungeons and gradually the curse dissapeared from the kingdom.

Despite knowing the cure, the King has taken the opportunity to create a show that attracts tourists from other kingdoms.

Tje king created a tournament where soldiers who were affected by the curse, and have not been treated, face each other in a battle to the death. The victor gains his freedom and the cure to the curse.

You are one of those soldiers and you must show your skill and cunning in combat against the rest.
