					<header class="align-left">
						<p><b>Ultimate Ghost Punch</b> is the premiere local multiplayer fighting game involving "Ghosts", "Punches" and "Ultimate" moves. Held against their will, <b>up to four knights</b> have to compete in frantic all-out battles to regain their glory, and most importantly, their right to live. Fighters can swing their <b>swords</b> quickly from the side, or with strength from overhead. They can also <b>grab</b> their oponents to throw them out of the arena, <b>jump and dash</b> to avoid dangers, or <b>block</b> any attack and grab with a well timed shield.</p> 
						<p></p>
						<p>But beware, the arenas are full of dangers, and whenever a fighter dies in battle, he returns temporarily as a <b>ghost</b> with the ability to steal other player's lives, as <b>a last-minute oportunity</b> to avoid losing for good. With their lives in danger, players have to continue fighting while avoiding the ghosts in a frantic and hilarious experience <b>ideal for playing with friends</b>. So get your sword ready, and prepare for the fight that awaits you in Ultimate Ghost Punch.</p>
						<p></p>
						<p> This game was created with <a href="https://spicy-noodles-studio.github.io/Gaia/">GAIA Engine</a>, a powerfull all-in-one tool for game development made by <b>Spicy Noodles Studios</b>, as part of the bachelor's degree in Video Game Design and Development from the <b>'Universidad Complutense de Madrid'</b>, in Madrid, Spain (2019-2020).</p>

					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/photos/alejandro.jpg" alt="" class="responsive"/></span>I was born in a Galician town called Camariñas in A Coruña, although I have always lived in Madrid, the capital of Spain. Since I was little I always wanted to make robots, but as I was growing up I also get quite interested in video games, so eventually I decided to study the Degree in Video Game Development at the Complutense University of Madrid. Thanks to this choice, I have begun to understand some of the difficulties developers have encountered when developing certain games, and it has also changed the way I play.  It is already difficult to enjoy a game without actively trying to find errors in it. In a way, how I entertain myself while playing games has changed.</p>

					<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/photos/martin.jpg" alt="" class="responsive"/></span>Born in Madrid back in the 90s, my last five years have always been tied to the video games industry, first as a journalist in the top two magazines in Spain, Hobby Consolas and 3DJuegos, and as a student of Game Development in the Universidad Complutense de Madrid. My passions are RPG games, Real Madrid and sleeping, which is something I never have the time for.</p>

For 3 years, my life as a developer has never stopped evolving. Since day one, I feel that the "developer world" does not stop teaching me new things and I hope it will continue like this for a long time. I still have a lot to learn, a lot to play, and a lot to demonstrate.</p>

When I was little, my parents bought me my first console: a Gameboy Advance. Since then, my hobby became playing video games. I like offline games more, where I enter the story they want to tell me or experience the feelings they want to convey to me. That is why I try to play video games of any era or genre, to discover something new everytime. Now I study to create my own games and make others enjoy them, in addition to being able to better understand the people who have made me enjoy their work.</p>

My name is Arturo and I was born in a town in Cádiz, Andalucía, called Chiclana de la Frontera. Since I moved to Madrid to study the Degree in Video Game Development at the Complutense University of Madrid, I have done nothing but study, but I like what I do and I will do my best to continue learning! I have always liked video games, especially I love the fantasy universes of Blizzard Entertaiment. I am one of those who prefer to explore even the smallest corner of a video game to find all the mysteries hidden and complete all the achievements that the developers propose us to achieve.</p>

From a very early age I became interested in videogames, and it was that hobby that made me decide to study this. I usually have a preference for strategy games, I’m a lover of the Civilization saga. I’m the kind of guy who likes to win by giving a show instead of trying it in the most optimal way.</p>
